    # About the app
    This app is written by [Magnus Kv√•le Helliesen](https://github.com/magnushelliesen).
    It runs on Google Cloud Run, and reads a pre-trained neural network from Google Cloud Storage.
    
    The code for the app can be found in [this GitHub-repo](https://github.com/magnushelliesen/handwritten-digit-recognizer-app),
    and the code for the neural network-package can be found in [this GitHub-repo](https://github.com/magnushelliesen/neural-network).

    ## About the neural network
    The neural network has {nn.n_hidden: ,.0f} hidden layers, with {nn.dim_hidden: ,.0f} nodes each.
    The neural network has been trained showing it {nn.training: ,.0f} random digits from the
    [MNIST dataset](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/).
